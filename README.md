# <p align="">Description</p>

This code creates a To-Do List app using React.

The app allows the user to add new tasks to a list and mark tasks as completed or delete them.

When the user enters a task into the input field and clicks the "Add Task" button, the task is added to the list of tasks. Each task has a unique ID, a task name, and a "complete" property that is initially set to false.

The user can mark a task as completed by clicking a checkbox next to the task. When a task is marked as completed, its "complete" property is set to true.

The user can delete a task by clicking a button next to the task. When a task is deleted, it is removed from the list of tasks.

The app is built using React components and state. When the user interacts with the app, the state is updated and the UI is re-rendered to reflect the new state.
